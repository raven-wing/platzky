    """Base class for content-transformer plugins.

    Subclasses declare which content types they want to transform via
    ``accepted_content_types``. That declaration is the set of choices a site owner is
    offered, not a grant: they still name each type in ``allowed_content_types``, and
    silence is refusal.

    A plugin with no technical constraint on where it runs declares
    ``ALL_CONTENT_TYPES`` — offering every type in the vocabulary, including ones invented
    after it was written. A plugin that does have a constraint names each type it can
    serve: one whose shortcode emits block-level layout markup, reaches an external host,
    or costs something to run cannot honestly claim to work anywhere, and naming its types
    is how it says so.

    Naming types is *not* how a plugin keeps itself out of comments — whether commenters
    may use it is the site owner's policy, and their grant already decides it. A plugin may
    also name a kind of content some other package brings — accepting one never means
    importing that package — and still install on an
    application that has no such content, where it is simply never called. To *bring* a
    content type, see ``PluginBase.provides_content_types``. The engine enforces final
    routing — ``Engine.may_transform`` decides, not the plugin, so widening
    ``accepted_content_types`` cannot widen the site owner's grant.

    Declare ``shortcodes`` to register shortcode tags; they are applied automatically by
    ``Engine.transform_content``, which is the only thing that runs a plugin — a plugin
    never transforms content itself, because running one is the registry's job and the
    gate is where it makes its decision. An application rendering a *stored value*
    through ``Shortcode.render_value`` bypasses ``transform_content`` entirely, so it
    must take its shortcodes from ``Engine.shortcodes_for`` to stay behind the same
    gate rather than reading ``shortcodes`` off loaded plugins itself.

    Override ``transform_text`` to
    apply plain-text transformations — the framework guarantees that
    ``transform_text`` is never called with shortcode tag markup so
    transformations cannot accidentally mangle tags intended for other plugins.

    What it does not own is which transformers exist and in what order: ``Engine.plugins``
    is that, uniformly for every capability, and the list arrives as a dispatch argument.
    Three things keep it there. Transformers chain, so their order is semantic, and it is
    set in two places — ``register_plugin`` appends, while ``platzky.py`` inserts the
    builtin shortcodes at index 0 to run ahead of any plugin filter. One instance may
    implement several capabilities and is registered under each, so only the engine sees
    the whole picture. And applications add capability bases of their own through
    ``extra_plugin_bases``, which ``register_plugin`` covers generically; a capability
    owning its plugins would be a second registration path that mechanism misses.
