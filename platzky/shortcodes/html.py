    Being ``"raw"``, nothing inside is parsed as a shortcode: ``[html][image url="…"][/html]``
    shows the tag rather than the image, which is what lets an author document a shortcode
    instead of invoking it. No text filter reaches inside either, so a plugin that rewrites
    prose cannot quietly edit what is in here.

    Verbatim also means HTML written inside reaches the page as HTML, and keeps doing so
    where ``STRIP_CONTENT_HTML`` removes the HTML around it: the flag has the site owner
    decide that prose is not written in HTML, and this tag is how an author says a
    particular piece of it is meant. That escape hatch is only open to whoever the caller
    vouched for — an author with CMS write access. Content nobody vouched for, a comment
    say, is escaped at the boundary before any of this runs, raw bodies with it, so a
    stranger writing ``[html]`` gets the characters shown back rather than a way in.
