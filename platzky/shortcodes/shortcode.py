"""What a shortcode is: the tag an author writes, and the class that renders it.

A shortcode declares its ``kind``, which says whether a closing tag belongs::

    [tagname attr="val"]                     # kind = "void"
    [tagname attr="val"]content[/tagname]    # kind = "block"  (the default)

Plugins register handlers through the ``shortcodes`` class variable on
``ContentTransformerPluginBase``. How a document of them is read and rendered — nesting,
raw bodies, what happens to a malformed tag — lives in :mod:`platzky.shortcodes.parser`.
