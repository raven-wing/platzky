        The slide count is written onto the element rather than inferred in CSS, because
        the timings depend on it: with N slides each is shown for one Nth of the cycle, so
        ``shortcodes.css`` carries one rule set per supported count and keys them off
        ``data-slides``. A count it has no rules for simply gets no animation, and the
        frames render as an ordinary sequence.

            attrs: Parsed attributes; ``interval``, ``width`` and ``animation`` already

            content: The frames' already-rendered markup. Embedded as-is per the ``render``
                contract; its ``Markup`` type says the escaping decision is made.
            children: One entry per frame, so a ``[figure]`` counts once however much
                markup it holds.
